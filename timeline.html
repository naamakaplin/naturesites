          <h2>War of Independence</h2>
          <small>(1947â€“1949)</small>
          <p>
            Started as 6 months of civil war between Jewish and Arab militias
            when the mandate period in Palestine was ending and turned into a
            regular war after the establishment of Israel and the intervention
            of several Arab armies. In its conclusion, a set of agreements were
            signed between Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, called the
            1949 Armistice Agreements, which established the armistice lines
            between Israel and its neighbours, also known as the Green Line.

          <h2>Sinai War</h2>
          <small>(1956)</small>
          <p>
            A military attack on Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, beginning
            on 29 October 1956, with the intention to occupy the Sinai Peninsula
            and to take over the Suez Canal. The attack followed Egypt's
            decision of 26 July 1956 to nationalize the Suez Canal after the
            withdrawal of an offer by Britain and the United States to fund the
            building of the Aswan Dam. Although the Israeli invasion of the
            Sinai was successful, the United States and USSR forced it to
            retreat. Even so, Israel managed to re-open the Straits of Tiran and
            pacified its southern border.

            Fought between Israel and Arab neighbors Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.
            The nations of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, and others also
            contributed troops and arms to the Arab forces. Following the war,
            the territory held by Israel expanded significantly ("The Purple
            Line") : The West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, Golan
            Heights from Syria, Sinai and Gaza from Egypt.

          <h2>War of Attrition</h2>
          <small>(1967-1970)</small>
          <p>
            A limited war fought between the Israeli military and forces of the
            Egyptian Republic, the USSR, Jordan, Syria, and the Palestine
            Liberation Organization from 1967 to 1970. It was initiated by the
            Egyptians as a way of recapturing the Sinai from the Israelis, who
            had been in control of the territory since the mid-1967 Six-Day War.
            The hostilities ended with a ceasefire signed between the countries
            in 1970 with frontiers remaining in the same place as when the war
            began.

          <small>(1973)</small>
          <p>
            Fought from 6 to 26 October 1973 by a coalition of Arab states led
            by Egypt and Syria against Israel as a way of recapturing part of
            the territories which they lost to the Israelis back in the Six-Day
            War. The war began with a surprise joint attack by Egypt and Syria
            on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Egypt and Syria crossed the
            cease-fire lines in the Sinai and Golan Heights, respectively.
            Eventually Arab forces were defeated by Israel and there were no
            significant territorial changes.

          <h2>First Lebanon War</h2>
          <small>(1982-1985)</small>
          <p>
            Began on 6 June 1982, when the Israel Defense Forces entered
            southern Lebanon to expel the PLO from the territory. The Government
            of Israel ordered the invasion as a response to the assassination
            attempt against Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo
            Argov, by the Abu Nidal Organization and due to the constant terror
            attacks on northern Israel made by the Palestinian guerrilla
            organizations which resided in Lebanon. The war resulted in the
            expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon and created an Israeli Security
            Zone in southern Lebanon.

          <p>
            Nearly 15 years of warfare between the Israel Defense Forces and its
            Lebanese Christian proxy militias against Lebanese Muslim guerrilla,
            led by Iranian-backed Hezbollah, within what was defined by Israelis

          <h2>Second Lebanon War</h2>
          <small>(2006)</small>
          <p>
            Began as a military operation in response to the abduction of two
            Israeli reserve soldiers by the Hezbollah. The operation gradually
            strengthened, to become a wider confrontation. The principal
            participants were Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israeli
            military. The conflict started on 12 July 2006 and continued until a
            United Nations-brokered ceasefire went into effect on 14 August
            2006, though it formally ended on 8 September 2006, when Israel
            lifted its naval blockade of Lebanon. The war resulted in a
            stalemate.
